🎯 Important Topics in Advanced AI
✅ 1) Transformer Architecture (Self-Attention Mechanism) (IMP)

🧠 What is the Transformer?
Introduced in the paper “Attention is All You Need” (2017), the Transformer architecture changed AI forever.
Unlike RNNs (sequential) or CNNs (local), Transformers look at the whole input at once and decide which parts of it are important using a technique called self-attention.


📘 Real-Life Analogy: Self-Attention
Imagine you're reading:
“The trophy didn’t fit in the suitcase because it was too big.”
You know “it” refers to “trophy”. This type of long-distance understanding is exactly what self-attention enables Transformers to do.




✅ Key Components of a Transformer
🔁 A. Encoder (for understanding tasks like classification)
➡️ B. Decoder (for generation tasks like text/image creation)
Each has:
Layer	Description
Input Embedding	Turns tokens into vectors
Positional Encoding	Adds order info to input (no recurrence needed!)
Multi-Head Attention	Looks at different relationships between words
Feedforward Network	Fully connected layers to learn complex patterns
Residual + Layer Norm	Helps deep layers train stably


✅ Self-Attention: The Core Magic
✨ Formula (Scaled Dot Product Attention):

✅ Python Example: Visualizing Self-Attention (Toy Example)
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Sample tokens
tokens = torch.tensor([[1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0]])  # 3 tokens

# Assume Q = K = V
Q = K = V = tokens

# Scaled dot-product attention
scores = torch.matmul(Q, K.T) / torch.sqrt(torch.tensor(tokens.shape[-1], dtype=torch.float32))
weights = F.softmax(scores, dim=1)
output = torch.matmul(weights, V)

print("Attention Weights:\n", weights)
print("Output Vectors:\n", output)




✅ Multi-Head Attention
Instead of one attention calculation, multiple heads look at different parts of the input in parallel.

💡 Think of it like:
Head 1: Who is the subject?
Head 2: What's the action?
Head 3: What are the objects?

Combining them makes the model very context-aware.



✅ Positional Encoding
Transformers have no loops or recurrence → so they add position info manually.

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def get_positional_encoding(seq_len, d_model):
    pos = np.arange(seq_len)[:, np.newaxis]
    i = np.arange(d_model)[np.newaxis, :]
    angle_rates = 1 / np.power(10000, (2 * (i//2)) / np.float32(d_model))
    angle_rads = pos * angle_rates
    angle_rads[:, 0::2] = np.sin(angle_rads[:, 0::2])
    angle_rads[:, 1::2] = np.cos(angle_rads[:, 1::2])
    return angle_rads

pe = get_positional_encoding(50, 64)
plt.imshow(pe, cmap='viridis')
plt.title("Positional Encoding Heatmap")
plt.xlabel("Embedding Dimensions")
plt.ylabel("Token Position")
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()
