🎯 Important Topics in Transformer Architecture
✅ 2) Self-Attention & Multi-Head Attention (IMP)


🧠 What is Self-Attention?
Self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence — for each word, it looks at all other words to understand context.

It answers:
“Which other parts of this input should I focus on to understand this token?”


📘 Real-Life Analogy
You're reading:
“She didn’t want to eat the cake because it was too sweet.”
To understand "it", your brain refers back to "cake" — that's self-attention in action.



✅ How Self-Attention Works (Simplified)
Given 3 vectors for each word:

Q = Query

K = Key

V = Value

We compute:

Dot product of Q and K gives a score of how much attention to pay

Softmax turns scores into weights

Multiply weights with V to get output




✅ Step-by-step Example (Toy Python Code)
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Simulated token vectors (3 tokens, 4 dims each)
tokens = torch.tensor([[1., 0., 1., 0.],
                       [0., 2., 0., 2.],
                       [1., 1., 1., 1.]])

# Q, K, V = same for self-attention (shared)
Q = K = V = tokens

# Compute dot product attention
d_k = Q.shape[-1]
scores = torch.matmul(Q, K.T) / torch.sqrt(torch.tensor(d_k, dtype=torch.float32))
weights = F.softmax(scores, dim=1)
output = torch.matmul(weights, V)

print("Attention Weights:\n", weights)
print("Output Vectors:\n", output)




✅ Why It’s Powerful
Looks at global context, not just neighbors (like CNNs)

Helps understand dependencies like "he", "it", or long-range meaning

Enables models to process input in parallel rather than word-by-word






✅ What is Multi-Head Attention?
Instead of computing just one attention, the model computes multiple attention heads in parallel, each learning a different relationship.

🎯 Why?
One head might focus on subject-verb

Another on adjective-noun

Another on position and syntax

✅ Process:
Input → Linear projections → Attention Head 1
                         → Attention Head 2
                         → Attention Head 3 ...
→ Concatenate all → Final Linear layer




✅ Code Concept (PyTorch Example)
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleMultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_dim, num_heads):
        super().__init__()
        self.attn = nn.MultiheadAttention(embed_dim, num_heads)

    def forward(self, x):
        # Add batch dimension
        x = x.unsqueeze(1)  # (seq_len, batch, embed_dim)
        out, _ = self.attn(x, x, x)
        return out.squeeze(1)

x = torch.rand(5, 64)  # 5 tokens, 64-dim embeddings
mha = SimpleMultiHeadAttention(embed_dim=64, num_heads=8)
output = mha(x)
print("Multi-head attention output:", output.shape)




✅ Self-Attention vs Multi-Head Attention
Feature	Self-Attention	Multi-Head Attention
Focus	One context pattern	Multiple patterns at once
Performance	Good	✅ Better (parallel learning)
Use Case	Used in each head	Used across heads in parallel




✅ Visualization
Input: "The cat chased the mouse"

Self-Attention (one head):
"The" → looks at "cat", "chased"

Multi-Head Attention:
Head 1: "cat" ↔ "mouse"
Head 2: "chased" ↔ "cat"
Head 3: "the" ↔ "the"
→ Combine all


✅ Real-World Applications
Use Case	Role of Attention
ChatGPT Text Generation	Helps model choose correct next word
Translation (English → French)	Aligns subject/verb positions
Text Summarization	Attends to important sentences only
Image Captioning (BLIP)	Attends to visual regions + text tokens





✅ Summary Table
Component	Purpose
Query, Key, Value	Core to self-attention computation
Self-Attention	Finds relationships across input tokens
Multi-Head Attention	Multiple attention heads for richer representation
Parallelizable	✅ Yes – allows faster training & longer input support





🧠 Final Thought
Self-attention is the reason Transformers understand full context, and multi-head attention gives them depth and nuance.

These are the superpowers behind:
GPT (text)
DALL·E (images)
Whisper (speech)
BERT (understanding)
