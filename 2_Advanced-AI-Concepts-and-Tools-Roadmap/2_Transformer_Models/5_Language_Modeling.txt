🎯 Important Topics in Transformer Architecture
✅ 4) Language Modeling (Masked vs Causal) (IMP)

🧠 What is Language Modeling?
A language model (LM) is a neural network trained to understand, predict, or generate human language.

Language modeling involves learning the probability of a word sequence:


📘 Real-Life Analogy
You’re texting:

"I’m going to the ___."

Your brain predicts words like “store”, “gym”, “office”.

That’s language modeling — predicting the next word (causal) or filling in blanks (masked).



✅ Types of Language Modeling
Type	Description	Example Model
Causal LM	Predicts the next word given previous context	GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-4
Masked LM	Predicts a missing word in the input	BERT, RoBERTa



✅ 1️⃣ Causal Language Modeling (Auto-Regressive)
The model can only see past tokens, not future ones — perfect for text generation.

🔁 Predict word-by-word:
Input:  The dog
Model predicts: "barked"
Input:  The dog barked
Model predicts: "loudly"



✅ Used in:
ChatGPT, GPT-4
Story generation
Code generation
Autocomplete


✅ Code Example: Generate text using GPT-2
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel

tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")

prompt = "In the future, AI will"
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(inputs["input_ids"], max_length=50, do_sample=True)

print("Generated:", tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))






✅ 2️⃣ Masked Language Modeling (Bidirectional)
The model sees the entire sentence and learns to fill in missing tokens.

🧠 Predict missing token:
Input:  The cat [MASK] on the mat
Model predicts: "sat"




✅ Used in:
BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT
Text classification
Named entity recognition
Feature extraction



✅ Code Example: Fill mask with BERT
from transformers import pipeline

fill_mask = pipeline("fill-mask", model="bert-base-uncased")
print(fill_mask("The capital of France is [MASK]."))




✅ Key Differences: Masked vs Causal
Feature	Masked LM (BERT)	Causal LM (GPT)
Input Visibility	Sees full sentence	Sees only previous tokens
Output Goal	Predict masked token	Predict next token
Training	Fill-in-the-blank objective	Left-to-right prediction
Use Case	Understanding tasks	Generation tasks
Examples	BERT, RoBERTa	GPT, GPT-2, GPT-3



✅ Real-Life Use Cases
Use Case	Language Modeling Type	Model
Text generation	Causal (auto-regressive)	GPT-3/GPT-4
Sentence embedding	Masked	BERT
Code suggestion	Causal	Codex
Masked word prediction	Masked	BERT
Chatbot / Dialogue agent	Causal	GPT
Classification (e.g., spam)	Masked	RoBERTa




✅ Summary Table
Concept	Description
Causal LM	Predicts the next word
Masked LM	Predicts masked tokens
Direction	Left-to-right (causal) vs Bidirectional
Model Examples	GPT (causal), BERT (masked)
Used In	Chatbots, QA, Classification, Summarization




✅ Bonus: Combined Modeling
Some models use both masked and causal approaches:
T5 uses a “text-to-text” strategy — everything is converted to a sequence generation task.
XLNet mixes auto-regressive and auto-encoding.
