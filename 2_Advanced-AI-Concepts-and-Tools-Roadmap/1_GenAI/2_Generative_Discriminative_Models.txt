🎯 Important Topics in Advanced AI
✅ 1) Generative vs. Discriminative Models (IMP)


🧠 What’s the Difference?
Type	Goal	What it Learns
Discriminative	Classifies or predicts labels	**P(y
Generative	Generates new data (like inputs)	P(x, y) → full joint probability distribution of input & label


📘 Real-Life Analogy
Imagine you're identifying a cat vs. a dog:
Discriminative: Looks at an image and says “This is 90% likely to be a cat.”
Generative: Learns how cats and dogs look, and can generate new cat/dog images from scratch.


✅ Discriminative Models – Focus on Boundary
Learn to draw the line that separates classes (without modeling how data is generated)



Examples
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Trees, Random Forest
Neural Networks for classification
BERT for text classification



✅ Example Code: Logistic Regression (Discriminative)
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

print("🔮 Prediction:", model.predict([X_test[0]]))




✅ Generative Models – Focus on Data Distribution
Learn how data is generated, then use it to generate new samples or predict


Examples
Naive Bayes (simple generative classifier)
Hidden Markov Models
Variational Autoencoders (VAE)
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
GPT, DALL·E, Stable Diffusion



✅ Example Code: Generate Text using GPT-2 (Generative)
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel

tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")

input_text = "Once upon a time"
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(inputs["input_ids"], max_length=40, do_sample=True)

print("📝 Generated:", tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))




✅ Summary Table: Discriminative vs. Generative
Feature	Discriminative	Generative
Learns	Decision boundary	Data distribution
Task	Classification	Generation, unsupervised modeling
Examples	Logistic Regression, SVM, BERT	GAN, GPT, Naive Bayes, VAEs
Output	Label probabilities	New samples or both x and y
Use in GenAI	❌ Rare	✅ Core foundation


✅ Real-World Applications
Problem	Type of Model to Use
Spam detection	Discriminative (Logistic Reg)
Email generator	Generative (GPT)
Image classifier (dog vs cat)	Discriminative (CNN)
Generate realistic face images	Generative (GAN)
Audio transcription	Both (Whisper = Hybrid)


🔁 Combined Models Example (GPT + Classifier)
You can even combine them:
Use a generative model (GPT) to generate text
Then a discriminative model to classify it (e.g., toxic vs. safe)
