1) General Machine Learning Terminologies: 
=> Supervised Learning: Machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data (input-output pairs).
=> Unsupervised Learning: A type of machine learning where the model learns from unlabeled data and finds hidden patterns.
=> Reinforcement Learning: An agent learns by interacting with its environment and receiving feedback in terms of rewards or penalties.
=> Training Set: Data used to train the model.
=> Testing Set: Data used to evaluate the performance of the model after training.
=> Validation Set: Data used to fine-tune the model and help with hyperparameter tuning.
=> Overfitting: When a model fits too closely to the training data, capturing noise and failing to generalize well to new data.
=> Underfitting: When a model is too simplistic and cannot capture the underlying patterns of the data.
=> Cross-Validation: A technique to assess the generalization ability of a model by splitting the data into multiple subsets and testing the model on each.
=> Bias: The error introduced by approximating a real-world problem with a simplified model.
=> Variance: The error introduced by the model’s sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data.
=> Model Evaluation: The process of evaluating the performance of the trained model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and others.

2) Regression Terminologies (Continuous Data):
=> Linear Regression: A model predicting a continuous output based on a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable.
=> Polynomial Regression: A regression model that uses polynomial relationships to capture more complex patterns.
=> R² (R-squared): A metric that measures the proportion of variance in the target variable that is explained by the model.
=> Mean Squared Error (MSE): The average squared differences between the predicted and actual values.
=> Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of MSE, providing error magnitude in the same units as the target variable.
=> Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.
=> Residuals: The differences between the observed and predicted values, used to analyze model errors.

3) Classification Terminologies (Categorical Data):
=> Logistic Regression: A model used for binary classification tasks, predicting the probability of an event occurring.
=> Decision Trees: A model that splits the data into different branches based on feature values, leading to a classification decision.
=> Random Forest: An ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.
=> Support Vector Machines (SVM): A classifier that finds the optimal hyperplane separating the classes in high-dimensional space.
=> K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric method that classifies a data point based on the majority class of its K nearest neighbors.
=> Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model.
=> Recall: The proportion of actual positive instances correctly identified by the model.
=> F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, useful for balancing both metrics.
=> Confusion Matrix: A table used to evaluate the performance of a classification algorithm by showing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
=> ROC Curve: A graphical representation of the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate at different thresholds.
=> AUC (Area Under the Curve): The area under the ROC curve. A higher AUC indicates better model performance.

4) Clustering Terminologies (Unsupervised Learning):
=> K-Means Clustering: A clustering algorithm that divides data into K clusters by minimizing the sum of squared distances from points to their centroids.
=> Hierarchical Clustering: A method that builds a hierarchy of clusters by either agglomerating smaller clusters or dividing larger clusters.
=> DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): A density-based clustering algorithm that identifies clusters based on dense regions in the dataset.
=> Silhouette Score: A metric that measures how similar a point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.
=> Davies-Bouldin Index: A metric that evaluates the compactness and separation of clusters, where a lower score indicates better clustering.

5) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Terminologies:
=> Data Preprocessing: The process of cleaning and transforming raw data before applying machine learning algorithms.
=> Missing Values: Data entries that are missing for certain features. These can be handled through techniques like imputation or deletion.
=> Normalization: Rescaling features to a specific range, usually [0, 1], to ensure they contribute equally to the model.
=> Standardization: Scaling features so they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, useful for models that are sensitive to the scale of the data (e.g., SVM, KNN).
=> Outliers: Data points that deviate significantly from other observations. Outlier detection techniques help identify and handle these extreme values.
=> Feature Engineering: The process of creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
=> Correlation: A measure of the relationship between two or more variables, indicating how one variable changes with respect to another.
=> Boxplot: A visualization that displays the distribution of a dataset, including the median, quartiles, and potential outliers.
=> Histogram: A graphical representation of the frequency distribution of a dataset.
=> PCA (Principal Component Analysis): A dimensionality reduction technique used to reduce the number of features in a dataset by transforming them into a set of orthogonal components.

6) Feature Engineering:
=> Feature Creation: Generating new features by combining or transforming existing ones to provide more meaningful input to the model.
=> Feature Selection: The process of selecting the most relevant features for the model, often using techniques like correlation analysis, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), or L1 regularization.
=> One-Hot Encoding: Converting categorical variables into binary (0 or 1) columns for each category, often used for nominal categorical features.
=> Label Encoding: Assigning a unique integer to each category in a categorical variable, typically used for ordinal features.

7) Feature Scaling:
=> Standard Scaler: Standardizes the data by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance, ensuring all features contribute equally to the model.
=> Min-Max Scaler: Rescales the data to a fixed range, usually [0, 1], which is useful when you need features to have a specific scale.
=> Robust Scaler: Scales the features using median and interquartile range instead of mean and standard deviation, making it more robust to outliers.

8) Model Selection Terminologies:
=> Cross-Validation: A technique to assess the generalization ability of a model by splitting the data into multiple subsets (folds), training on some folds and testing on the others.
=> Grid Search: A method for hyperparameter tuning that evaluates a model across multiple combinations of hyperparameters to find the best configuration.
=> Random Search: A hyperparameter tuning method that randomly searches over a specified hyperparameter space to find optimal values.
=> Hyperparameter: A parameter set before training a model that controls the model's training process (e.g., learning rate, number of trees).
=> Bias-Variance Tradeoff: The balance between bias (error due to overly simplistic models) and variance (error due to models that are too complex). Proper model selection aims to minimize both.
=> Ensemble Methods: Combine multiple models to improve accuracy. Examples include Bagging (e.g., Random Forest), Boosting (e.g., XGBoost), and Stacking.
