Real-time Comprehensive Example:
Scenario:
A company wants to determine if a marketing campaign has significantly increased sales and predict future sales.

Steps:
Probability: Model sales data distribution (Normal Distribution).
Hypothesis Testing: Test before and after marketing campaign (T-Test).
Regression: Predict future sales based on past data (Linear Regression).
