ðŸŽ¯ Complete Guide: Types of Regression in ML (with Python Code)

âœ… 1. Linear Regression : Models a straight-line relationship between independent and dependent variables.
ðŸ”¹ Use Case: Predicting house prices based on square footage.

âœ… 2. Polynomial Regression : Extends linear regression by adding polynomial terms.
ðŸ”¹ Use Case: Predicting car price based on age.

âœ… 3. Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization) : Penalizes large coefficients to reduce overfitting.
ðŸ”¹ Use Case: When thereâ€™s multicollinearity (correlated features).

âœ… 4. Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization) : Shrinks some coefficients to zero, performs feature selection.
ðŸ”¹ Use Case: High-dimensional data, feature selection.

âœ… 5. ElasticNet Regression (L1 + L2 Regularization) : Combines Ridge and Lasso.
ðŸ”¹ Use Case: When you want both feature selection and shrinkage.

âœ… 6. Logistic Regression (for Classification) : Used to predict probability for binary outcomes, not technically regression.
ðŸ”¹ Use Case: Email spam detection (spam or not spam)

âœ… 7. Support Vector Regression (SVR) : Uses SVM principles for regression.
ðŸ”¹ Use Case: When data is non-linear and you want to control margin.

âœ… 8. Decision Tree Regression : Splits data into regions, fits constant value in each.
ðŸ”¹ Use Case: Interpretable, non-linear patterns

âœ… 9. Random Forest Regression : Ensemble of decision trees â†’ better generalization.

âœ… 10. Gradient Boosting Regression : Boosting technique that builds trees sequentially to reduce error.
