ðŸš€ Step 3: Machine Learning Concepts

âœ… 1) Supervised Learning (IMP)
Definition:
In supervised learning, the model is trained on a labeled dataset, where the input features (X) and the correct output (Y) are provided.

ðŸ“Œ Goal: Predict an output (label) from input data.


ðŸ”¹ Real-World Examples:
Predicting house prices based on size, location â†’ (Regression)
Classifying emails as spam or not spam â†’ (Classification)
Diagnosing disease based on symptoms


Common Algorithms:
Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Neural Networks

âœ… Python Code Example (Supervised - Classification):

from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load sample dataset
data = load_iris()
X = data.data
y = data.target

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict & Evaluate
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
