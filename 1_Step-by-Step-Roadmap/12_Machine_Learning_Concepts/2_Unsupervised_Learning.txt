âœ… 2) Unsupervised Learning (IMP)
Definition:
In unsupervised learning, the model learns patterns and structure from unlabeled data â€” there are no predefined outputs.

ðŸ“Œ Goal: Discover hidden structure (e.g., groups, clusters) in data.


ðŸ”¹ Real-World Examples:
Customer segmentation (marketing)
Anomaly detection (fraud, faults)
Market basket analysis (association rules)


ðŸ”¹ Common Algorithms:
K-Means Clustering
DBSCAN
Hierarchical Clustering
PCA (Dimensionality Reduction)
Apriori / FP-Growth (Association Rules)


âœ… Python Code Example (Unsupervised - Clustering):

from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import pandas as pd

# Load data
data = load_iris()
X = data.data

# KMeans clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=0)
clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(X)

# View cluster labels
df = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=data.feature_names)
df['Cluster'] = clusters
print(df.head())
