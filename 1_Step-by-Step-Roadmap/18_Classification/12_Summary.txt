ðŸ§  Real-World Dataset to Try Them All
Dataset: Titanic Survival / Heart Disease / Iris
Try each algorithm and compare their performance using:

from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
print(classification_report(y_test, model.predict(X_test)))


Would you like me to:
Build a Jupyter Notebook that tests all these on one dataset?
Include grid search (hyperparameter tuning)?
Add visualization (confusion matrix, ROC curves)?
