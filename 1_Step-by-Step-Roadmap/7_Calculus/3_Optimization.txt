3. Optimization (IMP)
Optimization is the process of finding the best solution (usually minimum or maximum of a function).
In ML, it is used to minimize loss functions.

ðŸ”¹ Real-Time Example:
Optimizing weights of a neural network by minimizing loss using gradient-based methods like SGD, Adam.

Python Code (Using SciPy for Minimization):

from scipy.optimize import minimize
import numpy as np

# Define the function to minimize
def cost_function(w):
    return (w - 3)**2

# Minimize it
result = minimize(cost_function, x0=np.array([0]))
print("Minimum at w =", result.x)


Output:
Minimum at w = [3.]
