How These Concepts Apply in ML/DS:
Concept	Real Application
Derivatives	Gradient Descent, Backpropagation (DL)
Integration	Probability, AUC (Area Under Curve)
Optimization	Training models (minimizing loss function)

Visual Example: Cost Function Optimization
Imagine the loss curve as a parabola:
Derivative tells the direction to move.
Gradient descent follows the slope to reach the minimum.
Integration helps compute areas under probability curves (PDFs).

Future Concepts Built on This:
Partial Derivatives & Jacobians: For multi-variable optimization.
Stochastic Optimization: For large datasets (e.g., SGD).
Automatic Differentiation: Used in frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch.

Conclusion & What to Do Next:
Practice symbolic and numerical calculus using SymPy and SciPy.
Understand how derivatives and optimization power ML algorithms.
Use these skills to implement and optimize custom loss functions, models, and training loops.
