🎯 4) Gradient Descent & Its Variants (IMP)
Used in training Neural Networks to minimize the loss function and find the best weights.

✅ What is Gradient Descent?
Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize loss by updating model weights in the direction of steepest descent (negative gradient).

🧠 Real-Life Analogy:
You are on a mountain in the fog (loss function) 🌫️
You want to reach the lowest point (minimum loss)
Gradient Descent is like taking tiny steps downhill based on slope (gradient)

🔁 Basic Workflow:
Make prediction (forward pass)
Calculate error (loss)
Compute gradient (backpropagation)
Update weights using gradient descent
Repeat for many epochs

✅ Types of Gradient Descent
Type	Description	Pros	Cons
Batch GD	Uses entire dataset each step	Stable updates	Slow for large datasets
Stochastic (SGD)	Updates after each sample	Fast, online learning	Noisy updates
Mini-Batch GD	Updates after small batches of data	Combines benefits of both	Most commonly used


🔥 Variants of Gradient Descent

=========================================================================================================

✅ 1. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
Updates weights after every training example
Introduces noise → helps escape local minima

📌 Use Case:
Online learning (recommendation engines, real-time models)
from keras.optimizers import SGD
model.compile(optimizer=SGD(learning_rate=0.01), loss='binary_crossentropy')

=========================================================================================================

✅ 2. RMSprop (Root Mean Square Propagation)
Adapts learning rate using moving average of squared gradients
Prevents large jumps → works well on noisy data or RNNs

📌 Use Case:
Time series forecasting, recurrent models
from keras.optimizers import RMSprop
model.compile(optimizer=RMSprop(learning_rate=0.001), loss='mse')

=========================================================================================================

✅ 3. Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) ⭐
Combines the benefits of RMSprop and Momentum
Automatically adjusts learning rate per parameter
Most popular optimizer today!

📌 Use Case:
Image classification, NLP, any deep model (CNN, LSTM)
from keras.optimizers import Adam
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001), loss='categorical_crossentropy')

=========================================================================================================

✅ Real-World Example: House Price Prediction
Let’s say you're training a neural network to predict house prices.
Initially, your model predicts terribly (high loss)
You use gradient descent to reduce the error
You try SGD first → it’s noisy
Then use Adam → converges faster and more smoothly
Final model predicts accurately within $5K of actual price ✅

=========================================================================================================

✅ Visual Comparison
Optimizer	Convergence Speed	Stability	Use Case
SGD	Slow	Noisy	Real-time updates
RMSprop	Fast	Smooth	RNNs, noisy gradients
Adam	Fastest	Very Stable	Deep learning, NLP, CV

=========================================================================================================

✅ Summary
Term	Description
Gradient Descent	Basic optimizer to reduce loss
SGD	Faster but noisy, updates per sample
RMSprop	Adaptive, better for RNNs
Adam	Most used, fast & adaptive

=========================================================================================================

✅ Code Snippet: Model Optimizers in Keras
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.optimizers import Adam, SGD, RMSprop

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(10, input_shape=(5,), activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='linear'))

# Choose optimizer
opt = Adam(learning_rate=0.001)  # Try SGD or RMSprop here too
model.compile(optimizer=opt, loss='mse')
