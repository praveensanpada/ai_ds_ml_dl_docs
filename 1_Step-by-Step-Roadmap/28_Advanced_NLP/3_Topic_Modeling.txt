🎯 Advanced NLP Concepts
✅ 3) Topic Modeling – LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) (IMP)
Topic modeling is the process of automatically discovering topics in a collection of documents, using unsupervised learning.

🧠 What is LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)?
LDA is a probabilistic model that assumes each document is a mixture of topics, and each topic is a mixture of words.

🔍 It uncovers hidden topics without needing labels!

💡 Real-Life Analogy:
Imagine reading 1,000 news articles 📰 — instead of reading each, LDA can:
Group articles into topics like Politics, Sports, Tech, etc.
Show the most common words per topic
Show how much of each topic exists in a document


✅ Real-Life Use Cases of Topic Modeling
Domain	Use Case
🗞 News	Group articles by topics
🛍 E-commerce	Extract themes from customer reviews
💬 Chatbots	Understand user intent from chat history
🏥 Healthcare	Analyze medical records for common patterns
📚 Education	Discover dominant topics in research papers



✅ Key Concepts in LDA
Concept	Meaning
📝 Document	A single text (email, review, article)
📦 Corpus	A collection of all documents
🎯 Topic	A cluster of keywords like "health, doctor, patient"
🔑 Keywords	Words strongly associated with a topic
📊 Topic Proportion	Each document can belong to multiple topics


✅ Python Code: Topic Modeling with LDA using Gensim
import gensim
from gensim import corpora
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
import nltk

nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')

# Sample documents
documents = [
    "I love watching football and cricket.",
    "The government passed new healthcare reforms.",
    "Messi scored a goal in the match.",
    "Hospitals are improving their emergency services.",
    "India won the World Cup in cricket."
]

# Tokenize and clean
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
texts = [[word for word in word_tokenize(doc.lower()) if word.isalpha() and word not in stop_words] for doc in documents]

# Create dictionary and corpus
dictionary = corpora.Dictionary(texts)
corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(text) for text in texts]

# Train LDA model (2 topics)
lda_model = gensim.models.LdaModel(corpus, num_topics=2, id2word=dictionary, passes=15)

# Print discovered topics
topics = lda_model.print_topics(num_words=5)
for topic in topics:
    print("🧠 Topic:", topic)




✅ Sample Output:
🧠 Topic 0: 0.2*'football' + 0.2*'cricket' + 0.1*'match' + ...
🧠 Topic 1: 0.3*'hospital' + 0.2*'healthcare' + 0.1*'emergency' + ...




✅ Interpreting Results
Output	Meaning
Topic 0	Sports topic – talks about cricket, matches
Topic 1	Healthcare topic – mentions hospitals, reforms
Document 1: 70% T0	Mostly about sports
Document 2: 80% T1	Mostly about healthcare



✅ Summary: Topic Modeling with LDA
Feature	Description
📂 Unsupervised	No need for labeled training data
📚 Text discovery	Finds patterns in unstructured text
🔍 Topics	List of keywords for each topic
📊 Output	Probabilities of topics per document




✅ When to Use LDA
Situation	Use LDA?
You have a large set of text data	✅ Yes
You want to explore and understand themes	✅ Yes
You want keyword summaries per group	✅ Yes
You need exact labels	❌ Use classification




✅ Real Projects You Can Build
Project	Tools
News Article Clustering	Gensim, Spacy
Review Analysis on Amazon	NLTK + pyLDAvis
Topic Trends in Research Papers	Scikit-learn + Gensim
Chat Logs Grouping (Intent)	FastText + LDA
