üéØ Overfitting vs. Underfitting (IMP)
These are two major problems that occur when training machine learning models, affecting model generalization.

‚úÖ 1. Underfitting
The model is too simple to capture the underlying pattern in the data.

üîπ Characteristics:
High error on both training and test data
Model is not learning enough from data

üîπ Causes:
Model is too basic (e.g., linear model for complex patterns)
Not enough training
Irrelevant or too few features

‚úÖ Real-Life Example:
Trying to predict housing prices using only the number of bedrooms ‚Äî ignoring location, size, etc.
The model will underfit and perform poorly.

‚úÖ 2. Overfitting
The model is too complex and learns both the pattern and the noise in the training data.

üîπ Characteristics:
Very low error on training data
High error on test/unseen data
Model doesn't generalize well

üîπ Causes:
Too many features or parameters
Too little training data
Training for too many epochs (especially in deep learning)

‚úÖ Real-Life Example:
Using a deep neural network with 100 layers to predict housing prices from a dataset with 50 rows.
The model will memorize training data but fail on new data.

üõ†Ô∏è Python Code Example
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Generate synthetic data
X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=1, noise=20, random_state=42)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Underfitting model (very simple)
model_under = LinearRegression()
model_under.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred_under = model_under.predict(X_test)

# Overfitting model (very complex)
model_over = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=25)
model_over.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred_over = model_over.predict(X_test)

# Evaluation
print("Underfitting MSE:", mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_under))
print("Overfitting MSE:", mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_over))

‚úÖ How to Fix Underfitting & Overfitting
Problem	Solution
Underfitting	Use more features, increase model complexity, train longer
Overfitting	Use regularization (L1/L2), reduce features, use dropout (DL), collect more data, cross-validation

Overfitting	You memorized practice questions ‚Üí fail real exam
Good Fit	You understood concepts ‚Üí ace real exam
