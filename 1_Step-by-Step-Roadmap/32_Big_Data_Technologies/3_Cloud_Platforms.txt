🎯 Step 10: Big Data Technologies
✅ 3) Cloud Platforms – AWS, Azure, GCP (IMP)

🧠 What Are Cloud Platforms?
Cloud platforms provide on-demand computing, storage, and services to run your AI/ML projects at scale — without managing physical servers.
You can:
🚀 Train ML models with powerful GPUs
☁ Store terabytes of data
🧠 Deploy APIs, dashboards, and real-time apps


✅ Why Use Cloud in ML?
Benefit	Why It Matters
💡 Scalable compute	Easily train big models on GPU/TPU
☁ Managed services	No setup, just use APIs for ML, DBs, storage
💾 Massive storage	Handle TBs of images, logs, models
🚀 Easy deployment	Deploy APIs and notebooks in minutes


✅ 1️⃣ AWS (Amazon Web Services)
Feature	Description
☁ Compute	EC2 (VMs), Sagemaker (ML pipeline platform)
📦 Storage	S3 (object store), RDS (relational DB)
🤖 ML Services	Amazon SageMaker, Comprehend (NLP), Rekognition (Vision)
🔐 Security	IAM for permissions, VPC for isolation

✅ Used heavily in enterprise AI, MLOps, and research.


✅ 2️⃣ GCP (Google Cloud Platform)
Feature	Description
🧠 AI Services	Vertex AI, AutoML, Cloud Vision/NLP APIs
🚀 Fast hardware	TPUs for deep learning (TensorFlow optimized)
💽 Big Data	BigQuery (data warehouse), Dataflow, Pub/Sub
🔁 Integrations	TensorFlow, Kubeflow, Colab-like notebooks

✅ Great for deep learning, scalable pipelines, and fast prototyping.


✅ 3️⃣ Azure (Microsoft Azure)
Feature	Description
📈 ML Studio	No-code/low-code ML pipelines
🧠 Azure ML SDK	Python SDK for training, deployment, monitoring
🔐 Enterprise-Ready	Active Directory, enterprise security
📊 Data Services	Synapse, Cosmos DB, Data Lake

✅ Popular in enterprise, healthcare, finance, and compliance-focused domains.


✅ Summary Table
Platform	ML Tooling	Best For
AWS	SageMaker, EC2, S3	Full MLOps lifecycle, flexibility
GCP	Vertex AI, BigQuery	Scalable ML, deep learning, AutoML
Azure	Azure ML Studio, Synapse	GUI-friendly pipelines, enterprise



✅ Real-World Use Cases
Use Case	Platform Recommendation
Train large vision model (GPU/TPU)	GCP / AWS
Deploy fast REST API	AWS Lambda / Azure Apps
AutoML with UI	Azure ML Studio
Store and access big datasets (logs)	GCP BigQuery / AWS S3
Scalable model deployment	AWS SageMaker / GCP Vertex AI




✅ Common Cloud ML Services
Service	Platform	Purpose
SageMaker	AWS	Full ML pipeline (train + deploy)
Vertex AI	GCP	Managed model lifecycle + AutoML
Azure ML Studio	Azure	Visual interface for pipelines
Lambda	AWS	Serverless function deployment
Cloud Functions	GCP	Trigger ML on events
