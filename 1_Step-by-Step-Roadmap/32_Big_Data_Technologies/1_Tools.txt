🎯 Step 10: Big Data Technologies
✅ 1) Concepts & Tools: Hadoop, Spark, Kafka (IMP)

🧠 Why Big Data Tools?
In real-world ML/DL applications, data often comes in huge volumes, high speed, and variety.
Traditional tools (like Pandas) can't handle this. That’s where Big Data tools come in.

✅ 1️⃣ Hadoop – Distributed Storage & Batch Processing
Feature	Description
🔄 Storage Engine	Stores massive files in HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)
🧮 Processing Engine	Uses MapReduce to process data in parallel
🗃 Batch System	Best for offline, large-scale batch jobs
📊 Example Use Case	Analyzing 1TB+ of log data overnight

✅ Think of Hadoop as a data warehouse + batch processor for massive static data.


✅ 2️⃣ Apache Spark – Fast, In-Memory Distributed Computing
Feature	Description
⚡ In-memory engine	Much faster than Hadoop (no disk I/O)
💬 Multi-language	Works with Python (PySpark), Scala, Java
🧠 ML Support	Has built-in MLlib for machine learning
🧮 Use Case	Streaming, real-time pipelines, big ETL jobs

✅ Spark is used for fast distributed data processing and ML workflows over large datasets.


✅ 3️⃣ Apache Kafka – Real-Time Data Streaming
Feature	Description
🔁 Data Streaming	Handles real-time data pipelines (logs, events)
💡 Pub/Sub Model	Producers send data → Kafka → Consumers receive it
⚙ Integrates with	Spark, Flink, databases, microservices
📊 Use Case	Live dashboard updates, IoT, user behavior tracking

✅ Kafka is like a live message bus between data sources and consumers — perfect for real-time analytics & streaming ML.



✅ Summary Table
Tool	Main Function	Use Case Example
Hadoop	Distributed file storage + batch	Historical log analysis
Spark	Fast parallel computation	ML over millions of records
Kafka	Real-time data streaming	Processing live sensor or user data



✅ Together in a Real Pipeline:
[User Clickstream] → Kafka (stream)
                   ↓
             Spark (real-time analysis)
                   ↓
              Store to HDFS (Hadoop)
                   ↓
         Train ML model with Spark MLlib
