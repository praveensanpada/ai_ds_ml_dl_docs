🎯 3) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and LSTMs (IMP)
✅ Ideal for sequential data like text, time-series, speech, stock prices, etc.

🔁 What is an RNN?
An RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) is a neural network where outputs from previous steps are fed as input to the current step.

It’s like memory: it remembers past input and uses it to influence future predictions.

📘 Real-Life Examples of RNN Use
Domain	Use Case
📊 Time-Series	Stock price prediction, weather forecasting
✍️ NLP	Text generation, sentiment analysis, translation
🎧 Audio	Speech recognition, voice command systems
⏱ Sensor Data	Predictive maintenance, anomaly detection

🧠 Problem with Vanilla RNNs
RNNs struggle with long-term memory — they forget earlier context (e.g., long sentences or sequences).

✅ Solution: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
LSTMs are advanced RNNs with special “gates” that control what to remember and what to forget.

🔐 Gates:
Forget Gate – What to throw away
Input Gate – What to learn
Output Gate – What to output

✅ Python Example: Sentiment Analysis using LSTM (Keras)
We’ll classify movie reviews as positive or negative using IMDB dataset.
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import imdb
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense

# Load IMDB data (binary sentiment)
max_features = 5000
maxlen = 100

(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = imdb.load_data(num_words=max_features)

# Pad sequences to same length
X_train = tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(X_train, maxlen=maxlen)
X_test = tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(X_test, maxlen=maxlen)

# Build LSTM model
model = Sequential([
    Embedding(input_dim=max_features, output_dim=128, input_length=maxlen),
    LSTM(64),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # Binary output
])

# Compile
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=3, batch_size=64, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

# Evaluate
loss, acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"✅ LSTM Accuracy: {acc:.2f}")
