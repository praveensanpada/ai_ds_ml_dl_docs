🎯 Step 9: Model Deployment & Operations (MLOps) – Advanced
✅ 2) CI/CD Pipelines for ML/DL (Git, Jenkins, GitHub Actions) (IMP)


🧠 What is CI/CD in ML?
CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) automates the workflow from code commit to deployment in ML/DL projects.
CI/CD helps you:
🚀 Deliver models faster
⚙️ Automatically test & retrain models
📦 Push updates without downtime



📘 Real-Life Analogy
Think of CI/CD as a factory line for ML models:
🛠 Code goes in
✅ Gets tested
📦 Packaged into a model
🚀 Automatically deployed to production





✅ CI/CD Pipeline Steps in ML Projects
[Git Commit] → [Train & Test Model] → [Save Model] → [Dockerize] → [Deploy API]



✅ Key Tools & Their Roles
Tool	Role in Pipeline
Git	Version control for code and data
GitHub/GitLab	Hosts repo & triggers CI/CD
Jenkins	Automation server to run ML pipelines
GitHub Actions	CI/CD built into GitHub for ML workflows
DVC	Manages datasets & models like Git




✅ GitHub Actions – Example (CI for ML Model)
Create .github/workflows/ml-ci.yml in your repo:

name: Train and Test Model

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Train model
      run: python train.py

    - name: Run tests
      run: pytest



✅ Jenkins for ML – How it Works
Step	Description
🧱 Jenkinsfile	Defines steps: train → test → build → deploy
🔄 Triggers	Runs on Git push or schedule
📦 Artifacts	Can save trained model to S3, Docker Hub




✅ Benefits of CI/CD for ML
Benefit	Description
🔁 Automation	Automatically test & deploy new models
🧪 Quality Assurance	Prevents broken models in production
📦 Versioning	Keeps track of model/code/data versions
🚀 Speed	Faster releases with confidence



✅ Summary Table
Tool	Purpose
Git	Code & version control
GitHub Actions	Automate ML pipelines on push
Jenkins	Advanced, customizable automation
DVC	Track datasets & model binaries
Docker	Containerize training/inference
