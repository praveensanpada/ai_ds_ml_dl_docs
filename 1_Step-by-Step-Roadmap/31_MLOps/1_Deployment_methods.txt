üéØ Step 9: Model Deployment & Operations (MLOps) ‚Äì Advanced
‚úÖ 1) Deployment Methods ‚Äì (Flask, FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes, APIs) (IMP)

üß† What Is Model Deployment?
Model deployment is the process of making your trained ML/DL model available to users or systems via APIs, web apps, or microservices.


‚úÖ Real-Life Analogy:
Training an AI model is like cooking a great meal,
Deployment is like serving it hot to customers üçΩÔ∏è


‚úÖ Why It's Important?
Your model can be used in real-world applications
Enables real-time predictions
Powers apps, websites, mobile, and IoT systems



‚úÖ Popular Deployment Methods
Method	Description	Best For
Flask	Lightweight Python web framework	Simple ML APIs, fast prototyping
FastAPI	High-performance async API framework	Production APIs, fast & modern
Docker	Containerizes the model + code	Portability, isolation
Kubernetes	Manages Docker containers at scale	Large-scale deployment, autoscaling
REST API	Standard way to expose predictions	Web/mobile integration



‚úÖ Example Workflow
[Trained Model] ‚Üí [Flask/FastAPI API] ‚Üí [Docker Container] ‚Üí [Kubernetes/Cloud]



‚úÖ Example: Deploy with Flask
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import pickle

app = Flask(__name__)
model = pickle.load(open('model.pkl', 'rb'))

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.json
    prediction = model.predict([data['features']])
    return jsonify({'prediction': int(prediction[0])})

app.run()




‚úÖ Summary Table
Tool	Role
Flask/FastAPI	Serve model as API
Docker	Package environment + model
Kubernetes	Manage and scale containers
CI/CD	Automate training, testing, deployment
Cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure)	Run models in production
