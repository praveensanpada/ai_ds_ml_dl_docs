Real-time Practical Scenario (Advanced Example)
Scenario: You have three tables:
Employees(EmployeeID, Name, Salary, DepartmentID)
Departments(DepartmentID, DepartmentName)
Projects(ProjectID, ProjectName, EmployeeID)

Complex Join with Aggregation (Real Example)

SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.Name, d.DepartmentName, COUNT(p.ProjectID) AS TotalProjects
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
LEFT JOIN Projects p ON e.EmployeeID = p.EmployeeID
GROUP BY e.EmployeeID, e.Name, d.DepartmentName
ORDER BY TotalProjects DESC;


Explanation:
Joins Employees to Departments for employee details.
Left join with Projects to count total projects per employee.
Group by for aggregation.
