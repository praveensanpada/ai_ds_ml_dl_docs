🎯 Step 7: Computer Vision (CV)
✅ 2) Object Detection – YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN (IMP)
Object Detection identifies and locates objects (bounding boxes + class labels) in images or video streams.

🧠 What is Object Detection?
It’s a combination of classification (what is it?) and localization (where is it?)
The output is:
🔲 Bounding boxes
🏷️ Class labels
📊 Confidence scores




📘 Real-Life Use Cases of Object Detection
Industry	Use Case
🚗 Automotive	Detect cars, lanes, pedestrians (self-driving)
🏥 Healthcare	Detect tumors, polyps in medical scans
🏭 Manufacturing	Detect faulty products on conveyor belt
📷 Surveillance	Detect weapons, humans, vehicles in CCTV
📦 Retail	Smart checkout systems (Amazon Go)


✅ Popular Object Detection Algorithms
Algorithm	Description	Speed	Accuracy
YOLO	You Only Look Once – real-time detection	⚡ Fastest	High
SSD	Single Shot Multibox Detector	⚡ Fast	Medium-High
Faster R-CNN	Region-based CNN	❗ Slower	🧠 Most Accurate


✅ Real-Life Example: Detect Objects Using YOLOv8 with ultralytics
We'll use a pre-trained YOLOv8 model from the ultralytics library (easy & fast 🚀)

🔧 Install Required Library
pip install ultralytics



✅ Python Code: YOLOv8 Object Detection
from ultralytics import YOLO
import cv2

# Load pretrained YOLOv8 model
model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")  # n = nano version (fast & light)

# Load an image
img = cv2.imread("people.jpg")

# Run object detection
results = model(img)

# Plot results
results[0].show()  # Opens the result image with boxes

# Save output
results[0].save(filename="detected.jpg")


✅ Output from YOLO
Output	Description
Bounding boxes	(x, y, w, h) for each object
Labels (class names)	person, car, dog, etc.
Confidence scores	Likelihood that the object is correct


✅ Example: Real-time Object Detection from Webcam
import cv2
from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    results = model(frame)
    annotated_frame = results[0].plot()

    cv2.imshow("YOLOv8 Detection", annotated_frame)

    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()


✅ YOLO vs SSD vs Faster R-CNN
